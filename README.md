# CSc 46000: Health Failure Prediction

### Group Members
- Anthony Yang
- Asma Sadia
- Qing Lan

### Repository Structure

- `data`
  - `raw_heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv`: Raw data from the heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv
  - `cleaned.csv`: Cleaned and combined dataset used for modeling
  
- `code`
  - `etl_heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.py`: Cleans raw_heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv
  - `EDA_feature_selection`: Exploratory data analysis on the selected features for modeling

### Exploratory Analysis
We created a correlation heatmap to see which features are significantly correlated with the target variable, death_event. These features are time, serum_creatinine, ejection_fraction, age, and serum_creatinine. We looked at boxplots to undertsand the distribution of these features and density plots to understand the relationship between the features and death event. The `EDA_feature_selection` includes the excuetive summary of the analysis.
